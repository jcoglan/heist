module Heist

  # +Runtime+ objects represent instances of the Heist runtime environment.
  # Each +Runtime+ defines a top-level +Scope+, into which are injected
  # the standard set of primitive functions and special forms as defined
  # in <tt>lib/builtin</tt>.
  #
  # User code runs in another scope descended from the top-level. This is
  # done so that user-level redefinitions of built-in functions do not break
  # other built-in functions that refer to the redefined names; lexical
  # scoping ensures that built-in functions can only refer to other bindings
  # in the top-level scope so user-level bindings do not affect the built-in
  # library functions.
  #
  # +Runtime+ exposes several methods from the user-level +Scope+ object,
  # allowing runtime objects to be used as interfaces for defining
  # functions, eval'ing code and running source files.
